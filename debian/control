Description: Native ZFS for Linux! ZFS is an advanced file system and volume manager which was originally developed for Solaris. It has been successfully ported to FreeBSD and now there is a functional Linux ZFS kernel port too. The port currently includes a fully functional and stable SPA, DMU, and ZVOL with a ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) on the way!
